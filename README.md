## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)



### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Color Scheme

I used the [Jungle Color Palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/84872) from the website color-hex made by [Chad_torino](https://www.color-hex.com/member/chad_torino)

![J U N G L E Color Palette](/doc/readme-images/color-palette.png)

### Typography

If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

Kaisei HarunoUmi 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

I use the -webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px #be945b; for the headline.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

The wireframe shows designs for phone, iPad/tablet and desktop displays.

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

        ![Jungle Quiz - W3C CSS Validator Results](doc/readme-images/CSS-Validering.png)


### Javascript
When testing the JavaScript code for the first time, [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/) returned a few crucial errors because semicolons were missing in a couple of lines and I used an onclick() event in the index.html page. 

After fixing all the errors, JSHint returned 23 warnings regarding ES6. 

For example, 'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use 'moz').

At this juncture, I lack the knowledge on how to resolve this issue/warnings.

- ### Links Testing
- I checked all the navigation links to make sure they take the user to the right parts of the website.
- I manually tested the links on the menu page to ensure users go to the order form correctly.
- I tested the order form to make sure that after submitting, users are taken to the thank you page.
- I also inspected the Social Media links at the bottom of each page to make sure they take the user to the right page and open in a new tab.

### Browser Testing

### Device Testing
- I checked and tested the website on different devices like Desktop, Laptop, Samsung S21, and 14A, iPhone 12 PRO, and 14 PRO to make sure it works well on different screen sizes.

The website worked as I wanted it to. I also used Chrome developer tools on all the devices to test the responsive design, and it stayed intact for all sizes.

- I also tried the website on the following websites to test its responsiveness:
