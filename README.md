# PROJECT NAME TO GO HERE

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website)

Add a Blurb about the site here, what does it do, why did you build it?

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Color Scheme

I used the [Jungle Color Palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/84872) from the website color-hex made by [Chad_torino](https://www.color-hex.com/member/chad_torino)

![J U N G L E Color Palette](/doc/readme-images/color-palette.png)

### Typography

If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

Kaisei HarunoUmi 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

I use the -webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px #be945b; for the headline.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

The wireframe shows designs for phone, iPad/tablet and desktop displays.

#### 1. Welcome To The Jungle Quiz:

#### 2. Follow The Rules:

#### 3. Quiz Questions:

#### 4. Score:

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)
