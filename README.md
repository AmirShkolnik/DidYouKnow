### Color Scheme

I used the [Jungle Color Palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/84872) from the website color-hex made by [Chad_torino](https://www.color-hex.com/member/chad_torino) and the color red (#ff0000).

- I've used #e9ed60 & #422f25 as the primary and secondary colors for the site's text.

- I've used #422f25 as the overlay on the site's background image.

- I've used #e9ed60 & #be945b for borders on buttons, questions, answers, and the quiz area.

- I've used #52843c to show buttons.

- I've used #e9ed60 for button hover effects.

- I've used #ff0000 to indicate wrong answers.

- I've used #e9ed60 to highlight the correct answer.


![J U N G L E Color Palette](/doc/readme-images/color-palette.png)

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

I chose the [Lemon Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lemon?query=lemon&sort=alpha) for the site's font because it's a personal preference of mine. I find that the font has a visually appealing appearance that I personally enjoy. Additionally, it's easy to read, which is important for a quiz-style website where users need to quickly comprehend the text.

Furthermore, I believe that the Lemon font fits perfectly with the style and aesthetic of the quiz. Its clean and modern look adds a touch of sophistication while still maintaining a playful vibe, which aligns well with the overall theme of the quiz. Overall, I selected the Lemon Google Fonts because I found it aesthetically pleasing, easy to read, and fitting for the style and tone of the quiz.

Sans Serif is used as a backup font, in case for any reason the [Lemon](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lemon?query=lemon&sort=alpha) font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

![Lemon](doc/readme-images/Lemon.png)

### Imagery

I chose a jungle background for the website because of its thematic relevance to the website's title, 'Jungle Quiz.'

By incorporating an image of a jungle as the page background, I aimed to immerse the user in the atmosphere of a jungle environment, creating an engaging and immersive experience. 

This choice is intended to evoke the sense of adventure and exploration that one might associate with a jungle setting, enhancing the overall theme and appeal of the Jungle Quiz website. 

Ultimately, the jungle background serves to enhance the user's participation in the quiz, making them feel as though they are embarking on a thrilling journey through the heart of the jungle.

![Jungle](doc/readme-images/Jungle.png)

### Layout

The site is a single page with 4 steps/sections:
  - Welcome area
  - Rules area
  - Quiz area
  - Feedback and score area

### Wireframes

The wireframe shows designs for iPad/tablet and desktop displays, but the finished site is responsive to all devices.

#### 1. Welcome To The Jungle Quiz:

Features
--------

![All Pages](doc/readme-images/amiresponsive-mix.png)

### Welcome

I chose the quiz features based on their simplicity and user-friendliness. 

The landing page of the website has a straightforward layout, featuring a prominent H1 heading that clearly states the name of the quiz. 

Additionally, there are two large and colorful interactive buttons, making it easy for users to navigate and select their desired option. 

- Rules
- Start

By providing users with only two options to choose from, we aim to streamline the decision-making process, ensuring a hassle-free and enjoyable experience for all users.

![Welcome Page](doc/readme-images/welcome.jpg)

### Rules

If the user clicks the 'Rules' button, the instructions section will appear, allowing them to read the main rules of the quiz. Pressing the back button will return them to the welcome area.

![Rules](doc/readme-images/rules.png)

### Quiz

#### Questions and Answers

If the user clicks the 'Start' button, the first question will appear. The user will then encounter 5 captivating questions randomly chosen from a database of 20 intriguing queries. 

![Score](doc/readme-images/shuffle2.jpg)

Upon selecting an answer, correct responses will shine in yellow, while incorrect ones will be highlighted in red. 

![Questions and Answers](doc/readme-images/questions-and-answers.jpg)

The score will be promptly revealed, and within 2 seconds, the user will proceed to the next question.

#### Score and Feedback

After answering 5 questions, the user will be directed to the results page. Here, they will see their score and receive brief feedback. The feedback will vary depending on the user's results.

![Score](doc/readme-images/feedback.jpg)

### Future Implementations

- User can create a username and track his score.
- Shuffling the answer buttons.
- Generating questions across various subjects so that users can choose the area they wish to test their knowledge in.
- Establishing difficulty levels according to a timer.
- Background images and sounds will change according to the questions.
- Email JS to signup to newsletter.
- Ability to play sounds.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

        ![Jungle Quiz - W3C CSS Validator Results](doc/readme-images/CSS-Validering.png)


### Javascript
When testing the JavaScript code for the first time, [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/) returned a few crucial errors because semicolons were missing in a couple of lines and I used an onclick() event in the index.html page. 

After fixing all the errors, JSHint returned 23 warnings regarding ES6. 

For example, 'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use 'moz').

At this juncture, I lack the knowledge on how to resolve this issue/warnings.
